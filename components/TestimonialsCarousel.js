                Been visiting Alchemy since more than an year now. Never been to a better salon than this in Kannur. One stop for most beauty treatments big or small.
                The service of the staff to the quality of work they provide, is always commendable. Been taking my daughter too for her regular haircuts here. I would always recommend this place to anyone who wants the best salon experience in Kannur. Way to Go!

                Alchemy is hands down the best salon in kannur. I recently got done hair cut and hair color by their stylist Ali, and I'm super happy with how my hair has turned out. Thank you so much.

                One of Kannur's best salons, great vibe and friendly, helpful staff. Just had my  dermaplanning, hairdressing, hair coloring, and other beauty services and I was extremely happy with the result. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, the ambience was very pretty and aesthetic!
                I would always recommend this place for anyone who wants the best salon experience in Kannur!!!

                  Alchemy symbolizes the new Kannur. In a covid situation, the space they have is royal. Lovely staff adds more value. Hats off to the Management for making me feel that I am in a cosmopolitan city. The affordable charges is the icing on the cake. Simply Super.

                  If I wanna put up the review in one word I would say "Perfect". I had a lot of bad experience finding a good salon in kannur city. But yeah this place, overall everything was the best. The staffs were very friendly, professional and the environment looked overall cool. They even told me the overall cost before doing the service which many these days don't do (business tactics). I got the best results and I am totally happy about everything. Also the price was affordable when compared to many other parlours. There was no wait time and I never got bored.
